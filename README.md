## Project Overview
GeoDamage AI is a web-based application for **automated disaster damage assessment** using
**pre-disaster and post-disaster satellite imagery**.  
The system combines a **Vite + React frontend** with a **FastAPI backend** powered by deep learning
to generate **pixel-level damage heatmaps**.

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Dual Image Analysis (Pre & Post Disaster)**  
  Upload pre-disaster and post-disaster satellite images for change-based damage assessment.

- **Transformer-Based Damage Segmentation**  
  Uses a **Vision Transformer (ViT) + U-Net** model to perform accurate, pixel-level damage detection.

- **Interactive Web Interface**  
  Clean and responsive frontend built with **Vite + React** for visualizing damage results.
